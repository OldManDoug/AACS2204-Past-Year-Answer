1.
a.Encapsulation - the process of hiding the data variables and methods from the user. using the private access modifier 
  Inheritance - the process of making new classes from a singular general class.
  Polymorphism - the inherited class can have many different forms or behaviors in its sub classes, example: Superclass [] = new Superclass();

b. Differences between OOD and PPP
OOD - Uses objects to represent and perform operations
    - Has 3 principles, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
    - less complex - not needed long lines of code to perform a function

PPP- Focuses on functions and structures of program
   - Very complex, long lines of code necessary to do a function
   - Divided into 2 subcategories, modular programming and stuctural programming
c. Class and Object in OOD

Class - a template that stores data properties and methods of a program

Object - a representive real-world entity that is a instance of a class and has its own data properites and behaviors.

2. (i). Method overloading. The methods possess the same name but different data type and different passing parameters. The first method returns integer values, and the second returns double values. The parameters
are overloaded by methods calling each other. 
(ii). At line 6, will display 10,20.- as the a and b of the 1st method is initialised
