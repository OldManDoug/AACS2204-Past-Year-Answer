## Answers

### Question 1

a) 

- Encapsulation

  Encapsulation aims to wrap all data members and methods into one single unit to restrict its access from external classes. Restrict the scope of the data members helps to prevent the data from being tempered by external factors, which decrease coupling and increase maintainability.

- Inheritance

  Inheritance allows the creation of classes from existing classes. This can be achieved by creating abstract superclasses which are more general and later extending them into more specialised classes. This approach reduces the repetition of codes and establish a clearer relationship among classes, which enhance understandability and maintainability.

- Polymorphism

  Polymorphism describes an ability to reuse the same expression to achieve different operations. This can be achieved through overriding superclass methods and method overloading. This approach encourages code reusability which ease the system maintenance.
